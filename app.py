st.caption("This tool is designed to organize narrative feedback on anesthesiology residents in the United States. It is not designed to make decisions on progress through training or achievement of specific competencies. The algorithm built into this tool was developed at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. It learned from more than 10,000 free-text sentences across three different anesthesiology training programs. This web application is a testing environment to gain insight into how the natural language processing algorithm makes predictions. Since this is a testing environment, compute time takes a few seconds. When built into a dedicated system, this algorithm was shown to read and process several hundred narrative comments in approximately 1 minute.")
